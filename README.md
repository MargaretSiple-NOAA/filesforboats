# filesforboats
## Code files for the GOA survey planning and execution.

This repository contains code that I (Megsie) have been testing and adjusting. It is mainly to keep track of changes for version control. These are R code files that would be found on G:/AI-GOA/~ (Files for Boats). 

## `get.sunrise.sunset()`
This code takes latitude and longitude and returns the expected sunrise and sunset time. The script `test_sunrise_sunset.R` contains some code for testing this function.
